>  usa constitution is one of the smallest in the world

> decided to optimize it into a minimal version
> made it shorter AND clearer without losing functionality
> reduced it to 1,874 words and 86 rules
> even normies can understand it now
> still think it could be even more optimized
> this is just v1, but already a massive upgrade
> open to suggestions for further improvements
> tfw you accidentally make the Constitution based again
